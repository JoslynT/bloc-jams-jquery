"As a listener, I want to see basic information about the album so that I can decide whether I'm interested in it."
-I immediately see the album cover image and title, the artist's name, and some general release info.

"As a listener, I want to see the album's songs and play/pause songs by clicking on them so that I can change tracks."
-I see a list of the album's songs.

-When I click on a song, it plays.

-When I click on a playing song, it pauses.

-When I hover over a song, it displays a "play" button in place of the song number.

-The currently playing song displays a "pause" button in place of the song number.

-A paused song displays a "play" button in place of the song number.

"As listener, I want to have a set of standard music controls so that I have complete control over my listening experience."

-Regardless of scroll position, I see a "player bar" with controls for Play/Pause, Previous Track, Next Track, Seek, and Volume.

-The Play/Pause button shows a "play" icon if no song is playing.

-The Play/Pause button shows a "pause" button if a song is playing.

-The Previous Track and Next Track buttons only respond when a song is playing.

-The Previous Track button plays the previous song on the album.

-The Previous Track button doesn't respond if there is no previous song.

-The Next Track button plays the next song on the album.

-The Next Track button doesn't respond if there is no next song.

-I see a slider that shows the current time position of the song.

-I can click and drag on the time control slider to change the current song position.

-I can click and drag the volume slider to adjust the volume.
